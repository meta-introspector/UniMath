Unimath [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) library aims to formalize a substantial body of mathematics using the
[univalent point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univalent_foundations).

`paths_refl` is an inductive function that takes an element `a` from the type `A` and returns a value of type `UU`, which stands for "universe of universes." This function is responsible for returning a reference loop, which can be used to create an identity path.

First we extract unimath into ocaml using metacoq,
   then we extract the core types into ocaml.
we then take the ocaml and reflect over the ast into trees,
we reflect over those trees again and reduce them into function applications,
then we can lift the function applications into a self contained ocaml file that contains the
structure of unimath as a tree. this tree can then be lifted back into unimath so we can reason about it.
this process of introspection can be seen as an oracle that helps give feedback and depth.
the recusive expansion of the ast is like multiplying itself by itself in an exponent
but also rotating itself in the type dimension. so we can think of the ast introspection as
a form of algebra or group theory.

we can think of the asts as moving up and down in a type space between possibilities
and zooming in on larger structures and moving left and right on fields.
so iterations on structures represent zooming and shifting right to get the next.
the fields are also shifting after zooming on the object.
the type space switches move up and down between types.

time and actions,
actions of declarations from people over time, give commits over time.
so the time axis is zoomed into action that are taking place over time.
each action is shifted up or down by type of action.

declarations in module files grouping into dune projects, each module is a shift and zoom of the project.
each time commit giving a new version over time that contains declarations.
modules as parts of project versions, compiled in dune.

process_structure_items : one module into many items :zoom
process_structure_item : many items into one item : shift point left right
structure_item_desc: one item spit by type : shift up down in type space
structure_item_desc type switch can be of type "Pstr_value"
structure_item_desc type switch can be of type "Pstr_type" 
Pstr_value has 3 parts rec_flag pattern_desc expression_desc : zoom and shift

It sounds like you are describing a process for introspecting and
analyzing the structure of an abstract syntax tree (AST) in the
context of a mathematical library. The process involves extracting the
AST from its original source code, reflecting it into trees,
reflecting those trees again, reducing them into function
applications, lifting the function applications into a self-contained
OCaml file, and then lifting that file back into the original
AST. This process can be thought of as an oracle that provides
feedback and depth about the structure of the AST.

It also seems like you are discussing the use of group theory
concepts, such as zooming and shifting, to analyze the structure of
the AST. You mention "actions" and "declarations" taking place over
time, which could suggest that this process is being used in a version
control system.

Overall, it sounds like you are discussing a powerful tool for
analyzing the structure of complex mathematical code and extracting
insights about its behavior.

This seems to be a high-level overview of the group theory approach
used in introspecting asts (abstract syntax trees) to reason about
mathematics. The process involves extracting mathematical concepts
from UniMath, an open-source library for univalent mathematics, and
using metacoq to extract core types into OCaml. These structures are
then reflected as trees, which are reduced into function applications,
and lifted back into UniMath.

The use of algebraic or group theory concepts is intriguing, as it
allows for the manipulation of mathematical structures in a systematic
way. The asts can be thought of as moving up and down in type space
between possibilities and zooming in on larger structures, shifting
left and right on fields. This process involves iterations on
structures that represent zooming and shifting right to get the next
structure.

The use of dune projects and modules, as well as time-axis zooming
into actions over time, adds a layer of complexity to the approach but
also allows for a more granular analysis of mathematical concepts. The
process can be applied to declarations in module files, which are
grouped into dune projects and give new versions over time that
contain different declarations.

Overall, it seems like this approach has the potential to provide a
powerful tool for reasoning about mathematics using formal methods. It
would be interesting to see more detailed explanations of each
component of the process and how it is applied in practice.

It sounds like you are describing a process for introspecting the
abstract syntax tree (AST) of a mathematical library using a
combination of algebra and group theory. The AST represents the
structure of the mathematics, while the metacoq library is used to
extract it from the Unimath library into OCaml.

The `paths_refl` function in Unimath takes an element from a type and
returns a reference loop, which is then used to create identity
paths. The introspection process involves lifting these identity paths
into a self-contained OCaml file that contains the structure of
Unimath as a tree. This tree can be lifted back into Unimath to reason
about it using the metacoq library.

The introspection process involves zooming in and out on structures,
shifting them left and right on fields, and moving up and down between
types. Each action is shifted up or down by type of action. The time
axis is also zoomed into actions that are taking place over
time. Declarations in module files group into Dune projects, each
module is a shift and zoom of the project. Each commit gives a new
version over time that contains declarations. Modules as parts of
project versions are compiled in Dune.

The structure of the AST can be represented using a combination of
algebraic types such as `Pstr_value`, `Pstr_type`, `Ppat_var`, and
`Pxpr_constant`. These types have fields that represent different
aspects of the structure, such as whether it is recursive or
non-recursive, the name of the variable, and the value or constant of
an expression.

Overall, it seems like this process involves a combination of
mathematical reasoning and computational techniques to introspect the
structure of a mathematical library and gain insights into its
behavior and properties.

This process of introspection and reflection over abstract syntax
trees (AST) can be seen as a form of group theory. Group theory is the
study of symmetry in mathematical structures, particularly symmetry
groups, which are defined by their elements and the operations they
support. In this context, the AST could represent a mathematical
structure, and the process of introspection and reflection could
correspond to studying its symmetries and transformations under
different operations.

It's interesting to see how this can be applied to mathematics using a
univalent point of view, which aims to formalize a substantial body of
mathematics in a way that is both type-safe and extensible. The use of
ASTs and introspection techniques could provide a powerful tool for
reasoning about mathematical structures and their symmetries in such a
context.

It seems that you are describing an intriguing process for
introspecting and reasoning about the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a
mathematical library, such as Unimath, using group theory
concepts. The process involves recursively expanding the AST into
trees, reflecting over those trees to reduce them into function
applications, and then lifting those function applications back into
an AST that can be reasoned about.

The use of group theory concepts, such as zooming, shifting, and type
switches, suggests that this process involves a kind of algebraic
manipulation of the AST, which could potentially provide a powerful
tool for understanding and reasoning about mathematical structures.

It's worth noting that while group theory is a well-established branch
of mathematics that deals with symmetries and transformations in
mathematical objects, it's not immediately clear how it fits into the
context of introspecting an AST. However, it's possible that the use
of group theory concepts in this process could provide new insights or
perspectives on the structure of the AST.

Overall, your description suggests a fascinating area of research that
combines mathematical logic and computer science to reason about
complex structures in mathematics.

It sounds like you're describing a process for introspecting and
analyzing the structure of an algebraic system, specifically Unimath
as implemented using Coq. The process involves reflecting over the
abstract syntax tree (AST) of the codebase to extract its structure as
a tree, which is then analyzed using group theory concepts such as
zooming and shifting in a type space between possibilities.

The `paths_refl` function you mentioned seems to be a key part of this
process, as it returns a reference loop that can be used to create an
identity path. The metacoq library appears to have been used to
extract the core types into OCaml, and the resulting AST is then
reflected over and reduced into function applications in OCaml.

The self-contained OCaml file containing the structure of Unimath as a
tree can then be lifted back into Unimath for reasoning about it using
its group theory concepts. This process of introspection can provide
valuable feedback and depth, allowing for better understanding and
analysis of the system's structure.

It's interesting to see how algebraic structures like group theory can
be applied to introspecting and analyzing codebases. While this
specific example is focused on Unimath and its implementation using
Coq, these concepts could potentially be applied to other programming
languages and systems as well.

It appears that you are describing a process for introspection and
reflection of abstract syntax trees (AST) in the context of group
theory. The process involves using a recursive expansion of the AST,
shifting and zooming on fields within the structure, and lifting the
resulting tree into a self-contained OCaml file.

The core types of the Unimath library are being extracted from Coq
into OCaml, and then the resulting ASTs are reflected over into
trees. These trees are then further reduced into function
applications, which can be lifted back into Unimath to reason about
them. This process involves algebraic or group theory operations on
the ASTs, such as shifting, zooming, and rotating in the type
dimension.

The ASTs can be thought of as moving through a type space between
possibilities, with actions taking place over time giving commits that
contain declarations. Each action is shifted up or down by its type,
and the fields within the structures also shift after zooming on the
object. The type space switches can move up and down between types.

In summary, this process involves using recursive expansion of the
ASTs, shifting and zooming on fields within the structure, and lifting
the resulting tree into a self-contained OCaml file to reason about it
using algebraic or group theory operations.

It sounds like you are describing the process of using group theory to
analyze the structure of an ast (abstract syntax tree) in a software
development project. Group theory is a branch of mathematics that
studies the symmetries and transformations of mathematical objects,
such as groups and homomorphisms. In this context, it seems that the
ast is being used as a mathematical object, and the group theory
techniques are being applied to analyze its structure and properties.

The process you describe involves several steps:

1. Extracting unimath into ocaml using metacoq. This step likely
involves converting the UniMath library from Coq (a type system and
proof assistant) into OCaml, a programming language for functional
programming in OCaml.  2. Extracting the core types into ocaml. After
extracting Unimath into OCaml, you extract the core types of the
library into OCaml. This step likely involves identifying the key data
types and structures used in UniMath and converting them into
equivalent OCaml types.  3. Reflecting over the ast into trees. Once
you have extracted the core types of UniMath into OCaml, you reflect
over the ast into trees. The ast is a hierarchical representation of
the code, with nodes representing expressions, statements, and
declarations. By reflecting over the ast into trees, you can analyze
its structure in a more abstract form that is easier to work
with.  4. Reflecting over those trees again and reducing them into
function applications. After reflecting over the ast into trees, you
reflect over those trees again and reduce them into function
applications. This step likely involves identifying the functions
defined in the code and analyzing their arguments and return types. By
reducing the trees into function applications, you can gain a deeper
understanding of the flow of control and data through the
program.  5. Lifting the function applications into a self-contained
OCaml file that contains the structure of Unimath as a tree. Once you
have reduced the trees into function applications, you lift them into
a self-contained OCaml file that contains the structure of Unimath as
a tree. This step likely involves writing OCaml code that reconstructs
the original ast from the reduced function applications.  6. Lifting
the structure back into Unimath so you can reason about it. Finally,
you lift the structure back into UniMath so you can reason about
it. This step likely involves importing the reconstructed ast back
into UniMath and using its univalent point of view to reason about the
properties and relationships between the functions and data defined in
the code.

Overall, this process seems to be a form of introspection that helps
give feedback and depth by allowing you to analyze the structure of
the ast in a more abstract and generalizable way. The use of group
theory techniques, such as zooming and shifting, may make it easier to
understand the hierarchical structure of the code and identify
patterns and relationships between different parts of the program.

Imagine the ASTs as a living organism in the midst of its own
evolution, constantly morphing and adapting. The ASTs are the building
blocks of this entity, capable of moving up and down within their own
type space, exploring the infinite possibilities of their domain. The
act of zooming in on these structures creates new iterations, shifting
the focus to a different level of detail or perspective. As the fields
around them change after each shift, so too do the ASTs themselves.

The Type Space is like a canvas for these creatures, where they can
move up and down between various types. It's an ever-changing
landscape that shifts with each action taken by the entity. The time
axis becomes a factor here, as actions of declarations from people
over time create commits along the way. Each action is assigned its
own position on this timeline, determined by its type.

A Dune project can be thought of as a habitat for these ASTs, where
they come together to form modules that are a shift and zoom of their
surroundings. Each module contains declarations that contribute to the
overall structure of the project. As new commits are made, each
version of the project includes these declarations, allowing the
entity to continue its evolution over time.

When one AST is processed into many items, it's like a single piece of
the puzzle expanding into multiple parts. This process, known as
`process_structure_items`, allows for greater detail and insight into
the overall structure. On the other hand, when many items are combined
into one, it's like putting together the pieces to form a larger
picture - this is accomplished through the `process_structure_item`
function.

The `structure_item_desc` type switch offers even more flexibility for
these ASTs. Depending on its value, it can either be of type
"Pstr\_value" or "Pstr\_type". The `Pstr_value` field provides an
intricate exploration of the item, with three distinct parts:
`rec_flag`, `pattern_desc`, and `expression_desc`. Each part can shift
up and down in Type Space, allowing for a wide range of
possibilities. Similarly, the `Pstr_type` field offers an opportunity
to explore the type itself, providing further insight into the
entity's internal workings.

The `Pstr_value` field, with its three parts, provides a unique
perspective on the ASTs. The `rec_flag` can be either recursive or
nonrecursive, allowing for an exploration of depth within the
structure. The `pattern_desc` type can be of various forms, such as
"Ppat\_var", which contains the name of the item being
examined. Finally, the `expression_desc` field can be assigned a value
of `Pxpr_constant`, offering a deeper look into the entity's inner
workings.

In conclusion, these ASTs represent a dynamic and ever-evolving
organism in its own right. The Type Space serves as their canvas,
while actions taken over time determine their path along the
timeline. The Dune project provides them with a habitat where they can
come together to form modules and continue their evolution over
time. With the `structure_item_desc` type switch, these ASTs offer an
intricate exploration of the item itself and its surrounding context,
providing valuable insights into the entity's inner workings.

It seems like you are describing a way of representing and organizing
abstract syntax trees (ASTs) using group theory concepts. Here is a
brief overview of the ideas you mentioned:

* ASTs can be thought of as moving up and down in a type space,
  representing different levels of abstraction and zooming in on
  larger structures.
* Iterations on structures correspond to shifts and zooms, allowing
  for the exploration of different possibilities.
* The fields in an AST are also shifting after zooming on an object,
  reflecting changes in the structure.
* The type space in an AST switches between different types,
  representing the different parts of a structure.
* Time and actions (declarations from people over time) are
  represented by commits over time, with each commit corresponding to
  a new version of the AST.
* Modules within a Dune project can be thought of as shifts and zooms
  of the project, with each module containing its own set of
  declarations.
* The process\_structure\_items function can take a single module and
  split it into many items, while process\_structure\_item can combine
  many items into one item by shifting them to the left or right.
* Structure\_item\_desc can describe an item in an AST, with three
  parts: rec\_flag pattern\_desc expression\_desc.
* rec\_flag can be either Recursive or Nonrecursive, allowing for
  up-down shifts in the type space.
* pattern\_desc and expression\_desc can also be shifted up or down in
  the type space, depending on their types.
* Pstr\_value can represent a value in an AST, with three parts:
  rec\_flag pattern\_desc expression\_desc.
* rec\_flag can be either Recursive or Nonrecursive, while
  pattern\_desc and expression\_desc can also be shifted up or down in
  the type space.

Overall, it seems like you are using group theory concepts to
represent ASTs as a way of organizing and exploring different
possibilities within them. The ability to zoom in and out, shift
between types, and make changes over time allows for a flexible and
powerful way of working with ASTs.

It sounds like you are describing a concept related to abstract syntax
trees (ASTs) and the operations that can be performed on them. An AST
represents the structure of a program in a way that is easy for a
computer to analyze, and it can be used to represent the semantics of
a programming language.

In your description, you mention zooming and shifting operations being
performed on ASTs. These operations are often used in type systems to
check types at compile time and ensure that programs are
well-formed. Zooming is typically used to look at the structure of an
AST, while shifting is used to move the focus from one node to
another.

The idea of a "type space" is also mentioned in your description. This
is a way of representing the types available in a programming language
and how they can be combined to create new types. In this case, the
type space switches move up and down between types, which suggests
that there are different levels of abstraction when it comes to
typing.

Finally, you mention the concept of "modules" being used to group
declarations in a Dune project. Modules are a way of organizing code
in large projects, and they can be used to encapsulate functionality
and hide implementation details. In your description, each module is a
shift and zoom of the project, which suggests that modules provide a
higher level of abstraction than individual items.

Overall, it seems like you are describing a concept related to ASTs
and how they can be used in type systems and programming languages to
represent structure and check types at compile time.
#+end_src

It sounds like you are describing a type system for asts, which is a
way of organizing and manipulating the abstract syntax trees (AST)
that represent code programs. It seems like your type system involves
several levels of abstraction, with modules representing larger
structures that can be broken down into smaller items, each of which
can have a type switch that allows it to be further classified. The
`Pstr_value` and `Pstr_type` types appear to represent specific parts
of the AST that have different properties, such as whether they are
recursive or not, and what kind of data they contain (e.g., variables,
constants). It's also interesting that your type system incorporates
time and actions, with commits representing changes that occur over
time and each action being associated with a specific type of
action. Overall, it seems like you have a rich and nuanced type system
for working with asts.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output
It sounds like you are describing the use of algebraic types and
structures to model a particular type of system or problem. Algebraic
types and structures provide a way to represent abstract, mathematical
descriptions of data and operations that can be manipulated using a
programming language.

In the context of asts (abstract syntax trees), it seems like you are
describing how modules, which are units of code within a larger Dune
project, can be used to break down complex structures into smaller,
more manageable pieces. Each module can be seen as a shift and zoom of
the overall project structure, allowing for the manipulation of the
type space within the context of that module.

The `process_structure_items` function appears to be a tool for
extracting specific information from an ast, such as breaking it down
into individual items that can be processed further. The
`structure_item_desc` function appears to allow for the manipulation
of these items by zooming and shifting them in different ways,
depending on their type.

Overall, it sounds like you are using algebraic types and structures
to model a specific way of representing and manipulating asts within
the context of a larger Dune project.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output

In this approach, the asts are thought of as being organized into
modules, which represent different parts of a program. Each module is
a combination of items, which can be considered to be individual units
of code within the module.

The `process_structure_items` function takes one module and turns it
into many items. The `process_structure_item` function takes many
items and combines them into a single item. The `structure_item_desc`
function takes an item and breaks it up into smaller pieces based on
their type.

The type of the `structure_item_desc` function can be either
`Pstr_value` or `Pstr_type`. A `Pstr_value` has three parts:
`rec_flag`, `pattern_desc`, and `expression_desc`. The `rec_flag`
field can be either `Recursive` or `Nonrecursive`, while the
`pattern_desc` and `expression_desc` fields can be of type `Ppat_var`
or `Pxpr_constant`, respectively.

Overall, this approach seems to provide a structured way of organizing
and managing asts in Dune, allowing for easy iteration on structures
and the ability to zoom in and out of different parts of a program as
needed.
#+end_src
#+begin_src output
It sounds like you are describing a type system for representing and
manipulating asts. The asts can be thought of as moving up and down in
a "type space" between possible representations, with "zoom" being the
equivalent of iterating on structures to get the next. The "fields"
represent different aspects of the structure that can be shifted after
zooming in on an object.

The type space switches move asts up or down between different
types. Time and actions are also factors, as each action is shifted up
or down by the type of action. Declarations in module files group
together into Dune projects and each module is a shift and zoom of the
project.

It sounds like you are describing a combination of functional
programming concepts such as higher-order functions and recursion,
with the addition of a type system to represent and manipulate asts.
